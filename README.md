# Tanni (単に)

## Overview

Coming from the Japanese word Tan'ni which translates to simply, the goal of
this framework is to be a simple modern alternative easy to write with great
performance.

It leverages signals under the hood for modern reactivity and has a
SFC(single-file component) architecture similar to Vue.

It's inspired by:

- [Vue](https://vuejs.org/)
- [Solid](https://www.solidjs.com/)
- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)

***NOTE***: **work in progress**
